/*
Prerequisites-
For trees, you need to learn recursion first
OOPs should also be clear

------------------------------------------------------------

In Binary trees every node has 0/1/2 kids-
it can either be null or any value

------------------------------------------------------------

Reasons of using binary tree-
1. You can insert, remove, find items in O(log n) time.
2. Efficiently performing operations.
3. Items are stored in a order, on the left you'll find smaller
numbers and on the right you'll find larger numbers which makes
the data more organized. (BST)
4. It is cost efficient.

------------------------------------------------------------

Unbalanced tree makes the complexity worse [O(n)].

How to make sure tree remains balanced throughout?
Answer- Self balancing binary trees like AVL, etc.

Binary trees are inefficient for sorted data.

------------------------------------------------------------

Where is binary tree used?
1. File systems
2. Databases
3. Algorithms/Networking
4. Mathematics
5. Decision Trees in ML
6. Compression of files
7. Future Data Structures also use binary trees
